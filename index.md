## 9TH WORKSHOP ON PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF AUTOMATED REASONING
<p style="text-align: center;">Co-located with IJCAR 2024, July 2, 2024, Nancy, France</p>

### General Information
The Ninth Workshop on Practical Aspects of Automated Reasoning will take place on July 2 2024
in Nancy, France. PAAR 2024 is associated with the 12th International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (<a href="https://merz.gitlabpages.inria.fr/2024-ijcar/">IJCAR 2024</a>).

<p style="border:1px solid black;padding: 2px 4px"><b>Accepted papers are available!</b> See <a href="{{ "accepted.html" }}">Accepted Papers</a>.<br> Remember to register until June 4 (end of IJCAR early registration)!</p>

### Scope
PAAR provides a forum for developers of automated reasoning tools to discuss and compare different
implementation techniques, and for users to discuss and communicate their applications
and requirements. The workshop will bring together different groups to concentrate on practical
aspects of the implementation and application of automated reasoning tools. It will allow
researchers to present their work in progress, and to discuss new implementation techniques and
applications.

Topics include but are not limited to:

* automated reasoning in propositional, first-order, higher-order and non-classical logics;
* implementation of provers (SAT, SMT, resolution, tableau, instantiation-based, rewriting, logical frameworks, etc);
* automated reasoning tools for all kinds of practical problems and applications;
* pragmatics of automated reasoning within proof assistants;
* practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility studies;
* evaluation of implementation techniques and automated reasoning tools;
* performance aspects, benchmarking approaches;
* non-standard approaches to automated reasoning, non-standard forms of automated reasoning, new applications;
* implementation techniques, optimisation techniques, machine learning, strategies and heuristics, fairness;
* support tools for prover development;
* system descriptions and demos.

We are particularly interested in contributions that help the community to understand how to build
useful reasoning systems in practice, and how to apply existing systems to real problems.
